# 1.1 - Most favorite tasks (in no particular order):
* Help train and onboard new support teammates <= I am good at framing complex concepts in a simple way and have a proven track record of it at my previous workplaces. This is also an opportunity to learn more about that new teammate in terms of their approach, critical thinking and other abilities;
* Work with engineering teams during incidents and provide updates to internal and external stakeholders <= This is considered a crucial part of a support role, thus it's here on the list. If you don't like this, you might as well apply for another role;
* Respond to 25+ support requests via email every day <= Another crucial part of a support role which I am already doing at my current workplace and enjoy doing it;
* Identify, file (and, where possible, resolve) bugs in private and public Vercel/Next.js repos on GitHub <= There are several factors of what I like about this. The main one is due to my contributions brought into an open-source project;
* Write and maintain support articles and docs pages <= While the role entails provision of support, it's crucial to offset as much as possible to publicly accessible documentation so that people actually get to have value before even needing to reach out to support. In the long run, this also solidifies the brand value, since, most of the times, potential customers will choose a well-documented but flaky product over a perfectly running product that is halfway documented or not documented at all;
# 1.2 - Least favorite tasks:
* Find and recruit teammates for the support team <= This should not even be part of the role, since HR or Recruiting is supposed to handle this. I am fine with having interviews with potential candidates but headhunting them is not considered part of a support role;
* Work with people to figure out if Vercel is suitable for their use case <= This should be part of a sales or pre-sales role, not support;
* Act as a dedicated CSE for a handful of key customers to ensure their success using Vercel <= While I'm fine doing it, I don't necessarily like doing it since I prefer having a diverse set of customers and dealing with specific customer is very different than dealing with a broad set of customers;
* Create video tutorials to help teach users a specific feature or use case <= I actually like doing this but not in a work environment, since there is usually a thing called deadline which kills a lot of the inspiration;
* Work with 3rd party partners to track down a tricky situation for a joint customer <= While it's not generally my least favorite task, it can quickly become my least favorite when the 3rd party simply wants to throw all responsibility on me. Sometimes they simply don't want to deal with it and simply blames the product for which I am providing support
